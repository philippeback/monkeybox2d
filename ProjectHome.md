This is a port of Box2D by Erin Catto (http://www.box2d.org) to the Monkey language (http://www.monkeycoder.co.nz).

The port is directly translated from the Box2DFlash 2.1a code (http://www.box2dflash.org), with credits to BorisTheBrave, Matthew Bush and John Nesky for their work on that project.

See the QuickStart page for instructions on getting the demo running.

Please note that the demo is intentionally fairly intensive. This can mean that running it on slower computers/targets results in poor performance. In particular, Monkey demo users compiling to HTML5 on slow PCs may experience their browser declaring the demo to be unresponsive. You can work around this by editing maindemo.monkey and removing the heavier examples, such as the pyramid.
